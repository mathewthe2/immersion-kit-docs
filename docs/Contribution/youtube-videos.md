# YouTube Videos

We can use captioned Youtube videos to create example sentences in Immersion Kit.

## Find videos with creator subtitles

Locate a YouTube channel and copy its channel ID.

For example we have the following link:

    https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAzeU2QJI8_ImQoUtNTIGfA

The channel ID is *==UCAzeU2QJI8_ImQoUtNTIGfA==*

!!! info 
    If you are having trouble locating the channel ID, select one of the videos in a channel and on the video page click on the channel's link to be redirected back to an address that contains the channel ID.

Visit captionpop and search videos by the channel ID you obtained:

```
https://www.captionpop.com/japanese?channelId=[channel ID]
```

Select Japanese subtitles.

Click on the title of a video.

Scroll through the subtitles and have a quick glance to ensure these are creator subtitles and not machine-generated.
