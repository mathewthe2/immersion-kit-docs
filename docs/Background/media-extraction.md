# How do we extract screenshots and audio?

In the case of anime, drama, and movies, we use subtitle files to extract screenshots and audio.

In a subtitle file, every sentence has a **timing** - *begin* timestamp and *end* timestamp that matches each sentence to a certain part in the movie file.

By using apps like subs2srs and movies2anki, we could crop the audio and take a screenshot for each line in the subtitle file.
